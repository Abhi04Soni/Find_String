    <p id="String">Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values,
        attitudes, and preferences.[1] The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals, and some machines; there is
        also evidence for some kind of learning in certain plants.[2] Some learning is immediate, induced by a single
        event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulate from repeated experiences.[3]
        The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems
        to be "lost" from that which cannot be retrieved.Human learning starts at birth (it might even start before[5] in terms of an embryo's need for both interaction
        with, and freedom within its environment within the womb.[6]) and continues until death as a consequence of
        ongoing interactions between people and their environment. The nature and processes involved in learning are
        studied in many established fields (including educational psychology, neuropsychology, experimental psychology,
        cognitive sciences, and pedagogy), as well as emerging fields of knowledge (e.g. with a shared interest in the
        topic of learning from safety events such as incidents/accidents,[7] or in collaborative learning health
        systems[8]). Research in such fields has led to the identification of various sorts of learning. For example,
        learning may occur as a result of habituation, or classical conditioning, operant conditioning or as a result of
        more complex activities such as play, seen only in relatively intelligent animals.[9][10] Learning may occur
        consciously or without conscious awareness. Learning that an aversive event can't be avoided or escaped may
        result in a condition called learned helplessness.[11] There is evidence for human behavioral learning
        prenatally, in which habituation has been observed as early as 32 weeks into gestation, indicating that the
        central nervous system is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and memory to occur very early on in
        development</p>
